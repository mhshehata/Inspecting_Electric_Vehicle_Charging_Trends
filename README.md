The US Government's Alternative Fuels Data Center maintains a comprehensive database of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure, including charging ports, station locations, and EV sales. As the EV market continues to grow, analyzing trends in charging facilities and sales is crucial for strategic planning.

This yearly data, collected in December of each year, provides a decade-long snapshot of EV charging port installations and station locations, encompassing both public and private charging environments.
