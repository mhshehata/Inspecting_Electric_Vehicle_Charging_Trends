The US Government's Alternative Fuels Data Center maintains a comprehensive database of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure, including charging ports, station locations, and EV sales. As the EV market continues to grow, analyzing trends in charging facilities and sales is crucial for strategic planning.

This yearly data, collected in December of each year, provides a decade-long snapshot of EV charging port installations and station locations, encompassing both public and private charging environments.

## General Trends

Growth in Private Ports: The number of private ports has seen a steady increase over the years.
Moderate Growth in Public Ports: Public ports have also increased, but at a slower rate compared to private ports.
Rapid Rise in Sales: The total sales have experienced a dramatic surge, particularly from 2017 onwards.

## Specific Observations

2017 as a Turning Point: The year 2017 seems to be a significant point where the growth in sales accelerates significantly. This could be due to factors like increased EV adoption or policy changes.
Private Ports vs. Public Ports: While private ports have grown consistently, the gap between private and public ports has widened over time. This might suggest a shift in preference or market dynamics.

## Potential Implications

Market Demand: The rapid increase in sales indicates a growing demand for electric vehicles, driving the need for more charging infrastructure.
Infrastructure Investment: The growth in private ports suggests that private entities are investing heavily in charging infrastructure, potentially filling the gaps left by public infrastructure.
Policy Impact: Government policies and incentives might be playing a role in shaping the growth of both private and public charging infrastructure.
